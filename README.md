# F1 Track Dominance

This repository gives access to a track dominance (only fastest laps) at a particular F1 event. In the second cell you can enter the Grand Prix year and place, session type ('FP1', 'FP2', 'FP3', 'Q', 'S', 'SS', or 'R'), list of drivers (full names or first three letter of the surnames) and number of minisectors. The image below shows the track dominance by VER, LEC and HAM at 2024 Bahrain GP Qualifying.
